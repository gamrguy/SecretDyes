REQUIRES SHADERLIB TO FUNCTION!



A small mod to add a few special dyes

to the game using hidden shader effects.



The dyes are available in a variety

of colors for those that use it (one :P).



Obtain the dyes at the Dye Vat with

specific recipes involving Strange Plants.



Latest Update (2.0):

- Updated to latest ShaderLib version.
